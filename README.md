## Testing
```
pip3 install -r dev-requirements.txt

- All tests with benchmarking: `python3 tests/test.py --with-timer -v`

> Benchmarking results for all unittests will be stored in `tests/benchmarking.json`

- API unittests without benchmarking: `cd tests && nosetests units/test_api.py -v`
- Scraper unittest with benchmarking: `cd tests && nosetests units/test_scraper.py --with-timer -v`
- End to end API tests (takes a long time): `cd tests && python3 end2end/test_api.py`
